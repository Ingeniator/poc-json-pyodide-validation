What You Can Analyze

Dialog Length Distribution:
Compute the number of turns (messages) per dialog.
Identify outliers in very short or very long dialogs.
Role Distribution:
Calculate the ratio of messages from the user versus the LLM (assistant/system).
Check if one role overwhelmingly dominates.
Language or Sentiment Distribution:
If you have multilingual dialogs, you could use your language detection logic (Gate 4) to see if certain languages are over- or underrepresented.
Alternatively, perform a sentiment analysis if thatâ€™s relevant to your use case.
Temporal Patterns:
If your dialogs include timestamps, analyze when conversations occur (e.g., are they spread evenly over time?).
Topic or Keyword Frequency:
You might extract key phrases or topics from dialogs (using simple keyword extraction or clustering) to see if some topics are overrepresented.
