# 🧠 Quality Gates Pipeline for Dataset Validation

The **Quality Gates Pipeline** is a modular system designed to evaluate and validate training data for large language models (LLMs) through a series of well-defined "gates." Each gate represents a layer of checks focused on a specific aspect of data quality — from structure and cleanliness to content alignment and balance.

This approach is especially useful for projects using fine-tuning techniques like **LoRA** and aims to ensure data is robust, consistent, and useful for training high-performing models.

## 🚦 Overview of the 9 Gates

| Gate No. | Gate Name                     | Purpose                                                  |
|----------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | Structural Validation         | Checks format, field presence, and types                 |
| 2        | Deduplication & Decontamination | Removes duplicates and contaminated samples            |
| 3        | Content Availability          | Validates external references and links                 |
| 4        | Language & Encoding Consistency | Checks language, encoding, and input-output matching   |
| 5        | Balance & Distribution        | Ensures fair representation across tasks and labels     |
| 6        | Quantity / Size Check         | Verifies dataset is large enough and well-formed        |
| 7        | Automatic Quality Grading     | Scores helpfulness, correctness, and clarity using an LLM |
| 8        | Guardrail Compliance          | Applies hard safety and content constraints             |
| 9        | Manual Spot Review            | Human-in-the-loop inspection of selected samples        |

## 🧱 Gate 1: Structural Validation

**Checks:**
- Valid JSON or data format
- Required fields (`messages`, `role`, `content`)
- Correct types (e.g., list, string)
- Chat starts with `"user"` role (if applicable)

**Tools:** Pydantic, JSON Schema, Pydantic + Pyodide

---

## 🧹 Gate 2: Deduplication & Decontamination

**Checks:**
- Removes exact or near-duplicate entries
- Detects contamination with evaluation sets (e.g., MMLU, HumanEval)
- Filters copyrighted or restricted material

**Tools:** Fuzzy hashing (e.g. MinHash), similarity search, hash sets

---

## 🔗 Gate 3: Content Availability

**Checks:**
- All referenced links are live (e.g., URLs in content)
- Embedded media (images, audio, video) is accessible
- Avoids broken or outdated resource references

**Tools:** `requests`, async link validation, HEAD status checks

---

## 🌐 Gate 4: Language & Encoding Consistency

**Checks:**
- Input and output are in the same language
- Consistent language across message turns
- No garbled encoding (e.g., �, corrupted characters)

**Tools:** `langdetect`, `langid`, Unicode validators

---

## ⚖️ Gate 5: Balance & Distribution

**Purpose:**  
Ensure the dataset is representative, fair, and diverse across relevant dimensions such as role, class, language, and topic.

**Checks:**
- Avoids overrepresentation of certain intents, classes, or examples  
- Balanced distribution for classification tasks  
- Representative mix of user queries, message roles, and dialog structures  

**Tools:** Frequency analysis, label statistics, histograms, clustering, language detection, sentiment analysis

---

### 📊 What You Can Analyze

#### 🗨️ Dialog Length Distribution
- Count the number of turns (messages) per dialog  
- Identify outliers (e.g., dialogs that are unusually short or long)  
- Analyze average, median, and max length  

#### 👤 Role Distribution
- Calculate the ratio of messages from **user**, **assistant**, and **system**  
- Detect imbalances where one role overwhelmingly dominates  
- Useful for identifying skewed data or system-generated filler  

#### 🌐 Language or Sentiment Distribution
- Use language detection (see Gate 4) to detect over- or underrepresentation of certain languages  
- Perform sentiment analysis to understand tone patterns across dialogs  
- Identify potential emotional or cultural imbalance in the dataset  

#### 🕒 Temporal Patterns
- If timestamps are present, visualize dialog distribution over time  
- Detect clustering (e.g., most dialogs from a specific period)  
- Identify stale or outdated data samples  

#### 🏷️ Topic or Keyword Frequency
- Extract key phrases or cluster topics using NLP tools  
- Visualize dominant topics across the dataset  
- Spot topic overrepresentation or missing domains

## 📊 Gate 6: Quantity / Size Check

**Checks:**
- Dataset meets minimum sample threshold
- Enough examples per class, task, or category
- Not too small to generalize, not too large to overload

**Tools:** Simple counting, heuristic thresholds per task

---

## 🧠 Gate 7: Automatic Quality Grading (AQG)

**Checks:**
- Assistant response is factually correct
- Answer is complete, clear, and helpful
- Consistent tone, no hallucination

**Tools:** GPT-4, Claude, or any strong LLM using custom prompts or scoring models

---

## 🔒 Gate 8: Guardrail Compliance

**Checks:**
- Filters out toxic, offensive, or unsafe content
- Validates format structure (e.g., function call shapes, markdown limits)
- Ensures no PII, security risks, or misuse potential

**Tools:** Guardrails AI, custom regex filters, blocklists, transformers safety classifiers

---

## 👀 Gate 9: Manual Spot Review

**Checks:**
- Human-in-the-loop evaluation of edge cases or random samples
- Visual inspection for tone, logic, fluency, and style
- Reviewer feedback on borderline cases or uncertain outputs

**Tools:** Human QA interface, sample exporters, UI-based flagging

---

## 🧩 Pipeline Flexibility

- Each gate is optional and **individually configurable**
- You can define custom gates or modify existing ones
- Ideal for integrating with **Pyodide**, **LLM-based validation**, or web-based tooling

---

## 🚀 Use Cases

- Curating datasets for fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA adapters)
- Cleaning scraped or crowdsourced training data
- Checking alignment to safety policies or tone guides
- Validating multi-turn instruction datasets for chatbots
